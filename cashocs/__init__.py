r"""Computational adjoint based package for PDE constrained optimization

cashocs is based on the finite element package `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org>`_
and uses its high-level unified form language UFL to treat general PDE constrained
optimization problems, in particular, shape optimization and optimal control problems.

Note, that we assume that you are (at least somewhat) familiar with PDE constrained
optimization and FEniCS. For a introduction to these topics, we can recommend the textbooks

- Optimal Control and general PDE constrained optimization
    - `Hinze, Pinnau, Ulbrich, and Ulbrich, Optimization with PDE Constraints <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8839-1>`_
    - `Tr√∂ltzsch, Optimal Control of Partial Differential Equations <https://doi.org/10.1090/gsm/112>`_
- Shape Optimization
    - `Delfour and Zolesio, Shapes and Geometries <https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898719826>`_
    - `Sokolowski and Zolesio, Introduction to Shape Optimization <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-58106-9>`_
- FEniCS
    - `Logg, Mardal, and Wells, Automated Solution of Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23099-8>`_

However, the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial_index>` also gives many references either to the underlying theory of PDE constrained optimization or to relevant demos and documentation of FEniCS.
