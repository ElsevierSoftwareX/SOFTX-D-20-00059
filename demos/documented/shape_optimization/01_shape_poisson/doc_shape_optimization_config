## Documentation of the config files for shape optimization problems

Let us take a detailed look at the config files for shape optimization problems and
discusss the corresponding parameters and the possible choices. The corresponding
config file used for this discussion is located at
/demos/documented/shape_optimization/01_shape_poisson/config.ini

For the shape optimization, the config file is a lot larger compared to the config files
for optimal control (whose documentation can be found
[here](#documentation-of-the-config-files-for-optimal-control-problems)).
However, the most important parameters are shared between both types of optimization
problems.

A general config file for shape optimization has a total of 6 sections, namely Mesh, StateEquation,
OptimizationRoutine, ShapeGradient, Regularization, and MeshQuality. We go over these
sections and each parameter in them in the following.


**Mesh**

The mesh section is, in contrast to the corresponding one for optimal control problems,
more important and also has more parameters. However, its primary importance is for
remeshing, which we cover ind detail in another demo.

As first parameter, we have

    mesh_file = ./mesh/mesh.xdmf

This specifies a path to a .xdmf file containing the discretized geometry. For all purposes, cashocs assumes that this .xdmf file was generated via conversion from a
gmsh file using the command line command

    cashocs-convert in.msh out.xdmf

Note, that the corresponding files for the boundaries and subdomains are generated automatically with `cashocs-convert`, and they will also be read if they are present.
This applies to both uses of `cashocs.import_mesh`, so passing either the config file
or the path to the (main) .xdmf mesh file works here. Note, that the parameter `mesh_file` is only important for remeshing. For all other cases, the mesh can be imported / generated in whatever way you prefer, but it might not be possible to
read these files successfully with `cashocs.import_mesh`.

The second parameter in the Mesh section, `gmsh_file`, is defined via

    gmsh_file = ./mesh/mesh.msh

This defines the path to the gmsh .msh file which was used to create the .xdmf_file
specified in `mesh_file`. As before, this parameter is only relevant for remeshing
purposes, and not needed otherwise.

The next parameter is `geo_file`, which is the final file we need for remeshing (
and only there). It is also given by a path to a file, in this case to the gmsh .geo
file used to generate the `gmsh_file`. It is specified, .e.g., as

    geo_file = ./mesh/mesh.geo

Next up is a boolean flag that is used to indicate, whether remeshing shall be performed.

    remesh = false


As the remeshing feature is somewhat experimental, we do advise to always try without
remeshing. Note, that by default this flag is set to `False` and remeshing is disabled.

Finally, we have the boolean flag `show_gmsh_output`, specified via

    show_gmsh_output = false

This is used to toggle on / off the command line output of gmsh when it performs a
remeshing operation. This can be helpful for debugging purposes.

As stated throughout the Mesh section, these parameters are optional most of the time,
and only really required for remeshing. You can safely leave them out of your config file, and you should not need them, unless you want to perform remeshing.


**StateEquation**
